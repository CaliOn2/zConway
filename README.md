This Program simulates Conways Game of life in the terminal as a sort of screensaver.
To run it with different colors add the first tree letters of the main ansi colors after the program itself.
To get more info run the program with --help.

To build it you will need zig(Duh!) and libc, then run zig build in the directory.
